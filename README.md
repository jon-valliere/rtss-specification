# Real-Time Segmented Streaming
#### Segmentation format for large scale real-time delivery of multimedia presentations through an object caching infrastructure.

This is a preliminary specification, and it is being provided in an effort to establish open development of a specification for producing and consuming real-time Media through existing Content Delivery Networks.

This specification does not attempt to define a playlist format because it is desirable to work with other engineering groups to prevent duplication of efforts and promote cross-compatibility.

A Project Management Committee, consisting of industry members, is intended to be established to oversee the future work of developing and promoting the final RTSS specification.

While the attached preliminary specification and all images contained therein are copyrighted, the intention is that the author will be part of the intended Project Management Committee which will, upon completion of its work, prepare and release to the public the final RTSS specification.  It is the authorâ€™s expectation that rights to the final RTSS specification will be determined by the Committee with the permission and consent of the contributing parties.  

It is specifically intended that the Committee and all persons working with, on behalf of, or for the benefit of the Committee, shall have open access to the materials in the attached preliminary specification, and that the use of any copyrighted material, herein, for any purpose, other than for the purposes of the Committee, is reserved to the author.
